TODO :
	- !!! Modifier "Recieiver" par "Reciever" partout ... !!!
	- Add Id_Personnage to Arbre table, because the Poo part (the future implementation), is using it to get all the data. (More safe, unuse of string => good method)
	- Move the Description to every effect => 1 Description before the effect, and 1 Description after, in order to uncharge the Competence, and add other elements in it.




Probably TODO :
	- Add a new relational table between Personnage and Competence, in order to (at least) store the lvl of the Competence for the Personnage, 
	and have the "same" competence for multiple Personnage.
